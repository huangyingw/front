You  therefore  must  not  engage in any messaging or communications while engaging in promotional activities on behalf of Minds that, in Company's' sole discretion, constitutes illegal or abusive behavior, including  but  not  limited  to  any  content  that:  (i)  is  defamatory,  libelous,  abusive,  tortious or unlawful content; (ii) harasses, threatens or that is likely to do any of the foregoing to any  person  or  group  of  the  people;  (iii)  promotes  unlawful  acts  towards  any  person,  group or protected class; (iv) includes non-public information or that you do not have the right to  make  available  under  any  applicable  law,  rule,  regulation  or  contract,  or  otherwise  post any content that infringes or misappropriates any third-party rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights; (v) includes intentionally false statements or misrepresentations,  including  misrepresenting  aﬃliations  with  any  person  or  entity;  or  (vi) contains any viruses, malware, spam, junk mail, or any other forms of solicitation or destructive  code.
