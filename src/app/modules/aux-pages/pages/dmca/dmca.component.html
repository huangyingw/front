<h1>DMCA</h1>
<h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notice</h2>

<p>
  If you believe that material available on our sites infringes on your
  copyright(s), please notify us by providing a DMCA notice. Upon receipt of a
  valid and complete notice, we will remove the material and make a good faith
  attempt to contact the user who uploaded the material by email.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that we are unable to process DMCA notices that refer to sites
  hosted on third party servers that are using Minds Hosting software.
</p>

<p>
  Minds is an anonymous and encrypted social networking platform where channels
  and sites often use copyrighted materials in commentary or journalism, or
  transform the materials into something original of their own. As such, before
  submitting a DMCA notice, it’s important to consider if the manner in which
  the material is used falls under fair use. If you are not sure whether
  material located on a Minds channel or site infringes your copyright, or if it
  is subject to fair use protections, you should first consider seeking legal
  advice.
</p>

<p>
  Please be advised that you may be liable for damages (including costs and
  attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material or activity is
  infringing.
</p>

<p>
  Your DMCA notice will be forwarded to the party that made the material
  available, and also may be sent to third parties such as
  <a target="_blank" href="https://lumendatabase.org/">LumenDatabase.org</a>. A
  message will be sent to the channel site in question detailing the name of the
  copyright holder who submitted the takedown notice. In addition, you are
  required to consider the possible fair use implications, as a result of
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/important-win-fair-use-dancing-baby-lawsuit"
    >Lenz v. Universal</a
  >. We reserve the right to challenge abuses of the DMCA process, and your use
  of this form does not waive that right.
</p>

<h2>Filing a notice</h2>
<p><b>Please follow these steps to file a notice:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Verify that the channel or site in question is hosted by Minds. We have no
      control over sites marked “Powered by Minds.” Those channels or sites use
      the open source Minds software and are not hosted by us. Please contact
      the appropriate web host with complaints. We only host blogs that have
      “minds.com” in their URL or that say “Blog or social network or channel at
      Minds.com” on the site.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Contact the channel or site owner directly. Go to the status post in
      question and leave a comment with your complaint to see if the matter can
      be resolved directly between you and the blogger.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Send your complaint to our designated agent via the form below, if the
      issue cannot be resolved directly.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  As required by the DMCA, we have a policy to terminate users and/or sites that
  we consider to be repeat infringers. Although we won’t share the specifics of
  our repeat infringer policy (we don’t want anyone to game the system, after
  all), we believe that it strikes the right balance of protecting the rights of
  copyright owners as well as protecting legitimate users from wrongful
  termination. Please note that notices that are successfully countered,
  rejected on fair use grounds, or deemed to be fraudulent are not counted
  against a user or site.
</p>

<p>
  <b>
    Send your authorized and official complaint to (we prefer email):
  </b>
</p>

<p>
  Minds, Inc.<br />
  P.O Box 7681<br />
  Wilton, CT 06897
</p>

<p><a href="mailto:info@minds.com">info@minds.com</a></p>

<p><b>You must include the following:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person
    authorized to act on their behalf;
  </li>

  <li>
    An identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
  </li>

  <li>
    A description of the nature and exact location of the material that you
    claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit Minds to
    find and positively identify that material. For example we require a link to
    the specific blog post (not just the name of the blog) that contains the
    material and a description of which specific portion of the blog post – an
    image, a link, the text, etc. your complaint refers to;
  </li>

  <li>Your name, address, telephone number and email address;</li>

  <li>
    A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in
    the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
    agent, or the law; and
  </li>

  <li>
    A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under
    penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of
    an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
  </li>
</ul>

  Our DMCA Process
</h2>

<p>
  The process begins when a copyright holder (or someone acting on their behalf)
  submits a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) takedown notice to us,
  claiming that their content is published on Minds without their permission.
  They can submit a DMCA takedown notice via our form, email, or printed letter.
  After that, here’s what happens:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>We review the notice.</li>

  <li>If the notice is complete and valid, we remove the content.</li>

  <li>
    We notify the site owner and reply to the copyright holder to let them know
    we’ve taken action.
  </li>

  <li>
    We add a strike to the site owner’s account if they don’t counter the
    notice.
  </li>

  <li>
    If the site owner believes they have rights to use the content or that the
    notice was submitted incorrectly, we review and process their counter
    notice.
  </li>

  <li>
    We restore the content if the copyright holder doesn’t take further legal
    action within 10 business days.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 1: We Review the Takedown Notice</h3>

<p>
  When we first receive a DMCA takedown notice regarding a site, we review it to
  confirm that all of the required elements are present. Because the DMCA is
  law, we cannot accept a notice that’s missing any of the pieces outlined
  <a routerLink="/p/dmca">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to reviewing notices for completeness, we also assess their
  validity. Although we respect copyrights, we also support everyone’s right to
  use content within the boundaries afforded by the law. Specifically, we reject
  notices that appear to be fraudulent or where the content identified:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Isn’t copyrightable (for example, a person’s name).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Is content that the complaining party may not own the copyright for (for
      example, the subject of a photo isn’t necessarily the copyright owner of
      the photo).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Is fair use of copyrighted content.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: We Remove the Content</h3>

<p>
  If we receive a complete and valid DMCA takedown notice, we remove the content
  from the site and replace it with a DMCA removal message. For example, if we
  receive a DMCA takedown notice for an image within a post, we’ll replace only
  that image with a placeholder and insert text at the bottom of the post; the
  rest of the post and site will be unaffected.
</p>

<h3>
  Step 3: We Notify the Site Owner and Reply to the Copyright Holder
</h3>

<p>
  Whenever we remove content from a site in response to a DMCA takedown notice
  we email the site owner and provide a copy of the original complaint. We also
  notify the copyright holder to let them know that the allegedly infringing
  content has been removed.
</p>

<p>
  If the site owner wants to republish the post, they can edit the post to
  remove the specific content at issue. (This is only an option when only a
  portion of a post was identified as infringing.) After making the changes, the
  site owner must reply to our message to request removal of the DMCA takedown
  message.
</p>

<p>
  Channel and site owners cannot, under any circumstances, republish the
  allegedly infringing content. Republishing content that was removed after
  receipt of a valid DMCA takedown notice could result in the site being
  permanently suspended from Minds.com. If the counter notice procedure is
  followed, we’ll restore the content at the appropriate time.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: We Add a Strike</h3>

<p>
  We’re required by the DMCA to have a repeat infringer policy, so if a site
  owner doesn’t counter a complete and valid DMCA takedown notice, we add a
  strike to their account.
</p>

<p>
  We assess strikes after 10 business days, so that no one’s site is suspended
  before they have a chance to review the issue and submit a valid counter
  notice.
</p>

<h3>Step 5: We Review and Process the Counter Notice</h3>

<p>
  Sometimes a site owner will disagree with the DMCA takedown notice, believing
  that they are lawfully using the content. We encourage site owners to submit a
  counter notice if this is the case. After reviewing the counter notice for
  completeness, we reply to the site owner and notify the copyright holder,
  providing them with a copy.
</p>

<h3>Step 6: We Restore the Content</h3>

<p>
  In spite of the counter notice, the site owner cannot republish the content
  because the copyright holder then has 10 business days to initiate legal
  proceedings against the site owner to prevent them from using their content on
  Minds. If at the end of the 10 business days, the copyright holder hasn’t
  initiated legal proceedings, the DMCA requires us to restore the content.
</p>

<h2>Copyright and Fair Use</h2>

<p>
  Minds is a publishing, rather than a file sharing platform, so copyrighted
  materials are often used in commentary, journalism, or the transformation of
  the material into something original of their own. As such, it’s important to
  consider if the manner in which the material is used falls under fair use,
  before submitting a DMCA notice. Under
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512"
    >Section 512(f) of the DMCA</a
  >, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity
  is infringing is liable for:
</p>

<p>
  …any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged
  infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or
  by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result
  of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or
  disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in
  replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that Minds may seek to collect those damages. We reserve the right
  to do so in the future as recourse for notices we deem to be improper. This
  includes DMCA notices aimed at uses of copyrighted content that we believe to
  be fair. Additionally, you are required to give consideration to whether a use
  of material is fair before submitting a takedown notification, as a result of
  the decision in
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/important-win-fair-use-dancing-baby-lawsuit"
    >Lenz v. Universal</a
  >.
</p>

<h3>What is fair use?</h3>

<p>
  There aren’t hard and fast rules when it comes to defining fair use. However,
  the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html"
    >Copyright Act</a
  >
  sets out four factors for courts to consider:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The purpose and character of the use: Why and how is the material used?
      Using content for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,
      scholarship or research is usually fair. Additionally, using material in a
      transformative manner, that is to say, in a manner that adds new
      expression, meaning, or insight, is also more likely to be considered fair
      use over an exact reproduction of a work. What’s more, nonprofit use is
      favored over commercial use.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The nature of the copyrighted work: Is the original factual or fiction,
      published or unpublished? Factual and published works are less protected,
      so its use is more likely to be considered fair.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
      copyrighted work as a whole: How much of the material is used? If the
      “heart” (the most memorable or significant portion) or the majority of a
      work wasn’t used, it’s more likely to be considered fair.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the
      copyrighted work: Does the use target a different market/audience? If so,
      it’s more likely to be fair use. It’s important to note that although
      criticism or parody may reduce a market, it still may be fair because of
      its transformative nature. In other words, if the criticism of a product
      influences people to stop buying the product, that doesn’t count as having
      an “effect on the market for the work” under copyright law.
    </p>
  </li>
